Summary: Annoucing PyWren 0.2, bugfix release and interactive setup script. 
status: draft

Today we're excited to release PyWren version 0.2. This release contains
a number of important bug fixes, as well as a new getting started script. 

### Getting Started

We'd like for PyWren to be as easy to use as possible, so we have put together a 
new getting started script for new users. Simply run

```
pywren-setup
```
and follow the prompts! 

See more in [our getting started section]({filename}/pages/gettingstarted.md)

### Notable bug fixes and improvements behind the scenes

* We reorganized the PyWren code internally to make it easier to 
understand and extend. 
* We fixed a number of serialization bugs so that it's easier to use
PyWren from [IPython](https://ipython.org/) and
with [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/)
